# ML-for-CreditCard-FraudDetection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning. I used a real-world anonymized dataset from Kaggle, containing transactions made by European cardholders in 2013.

## Objectives:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Class imbalance handling using SMOTE
- Model training with Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM
- Evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Feature importance analysis

## Tools & Libraries:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, imbalanced-learn
- Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM

The purpose of this project was to gain hands-on experience applying machine learning to a real-world problem. It provided me with great practice in training, evaluating, and interpreting models for rare-event detection.
